# news-explorer-frontend

Hello there! This is the 1st stage of the NewsExplorer App. In this stage a user can search and save articles via a search button powered by News API. You can also sign up, sign in and logout.  Since there is currently no backend the app has been made to showcase developmental functionality. When loggin in/signing up the inputs can be bypassed for a hardcoded loggedin session. Make sure to login and try out the save-articles function and check out the saved items on the /saved-articles page.
